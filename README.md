# Fantasy Draft Tool

This is my personal tool to support Live Fantasy Drafts.
- Player data is sourced from [ffToday Rankings](https://fftoday.com/rankings/playerrank.php?o=1&RankType=redraft&Scoring=3&PosID=10&LeagueID=1)
- "Drafting" a player will hide them from display and has persistence to protect from loss of draft status if page is refreshed
- Functionality is currently only used from running as `localhost`
